This was done for my graphics project at the university of waterloo.  It must
be noted that the point of the project was NOT the actual chess, but rather
the graphics of it.  So you will notice obvious bugs in the Chess logic.  I plan
to fix all of these either by improving the backend engine or just ripping my
engine out and sticking in an open source one.  

WHAT YOU NEED:

You'll need gtkmm version 2.4, lua5.1, OpenAL, GLEW, GLUT, and at least OpenGL
2.1.  You don't need an amazing graphics card but a decent one is needed.  The
program is GPU heavy and it lags when run in software mode.  My macbook runs it
fine so anything with a decent graphics card should do.  

CONTROLS:

In perspective mode, left mouse button translates x and y, middle mouse button
translates along z, and left mouse button rotates the board.  In game mode, 
clicking a piece will select it, and clicking a square will result in a move.
In camera mode, left mouse button rotates the camera around the scene.
NOTE: I currently have no good feedback for when a piece is clicked, or if a 
move failed.  Furthermore the game 'moo's' when someone checkmates.  I'll 
work on improving all of these issues.  

Finally, I'm well aware that the code isn't the best it could be.  I had 3 
weeks to finish this so the best code practices weren't always in my head...
especially after two straight all nighters trying to meet the deadline!

Enjoy the game!  Any feedback is appreciated.
